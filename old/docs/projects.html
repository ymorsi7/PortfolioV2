			<div class="columns is-multiline is-desktop">
				<p class="intro1">
					The final goal of MiniMe is the successful creation of a bipedal robot that can avoid obstacles on
					its own.
					First, a small biped will be built using an Arduino Uno. Subsequently, remote-control capabilities
					will be added
					to the Arduino biped. After this, a camera will be mounted to this biped, and using OpenCV and
					PyTorch, the biped
					will be able to detect, then avoid objects. Using Machine Learning, the Arduino biped will walk
					through open areas and
					avoid objects while identifying them. Once the code is fully functional on this biped, a 1.5-foot
					tall biped will be designed
					with CAD software and 3D printed. Further machine learning technology will be explored upon the
					completion of the final
					biped.<br><br>

			</div>

			<div class="columns is-multiline is-desktop">
				<p class="intro1">
					With all the time I spend on undergraduate coursework, research, and programming projects,
					I decided to save time by creating an AI version of myself to talk to my friends. First, I used
					Python
					to create a Discord bot that sorts through conversations in a server that I'm active in
					and generates transcripts containing them. After this, I used PyTorch
					to interpret the transcripts and create a text file containing only my messages and what they were
					in response to.
					I then used Pytorch to build a chatbot using the new generated text file. <br><br></p>
				<p class="intro1">
					Using Python once again, I created another Discord bot that takes in messages from a Discord group
					server, runs it
					through the Pytorch code, and outputs the result in Discord.<br><br></p>

				<p class="intro1">The code for this project has been created. However, the project is currently in the
					data
					collection phase. When complete, the code will be interpreted, and the AI Discord bot will be
					deployed.

			</div>

			<div class="columns is-multiline is-desktop">
				<p class="intro1">
					For our final project in our Rapid Software and Hardware Design course at UCSD, we used some of the
					skills we learned throughout the quarter to create a design that we had in mind. Swaying Attention
					is a project that aims to tackle the problem of dozing off during online class. Students not paying
					attention in class was a problem when school is in person but now that most students are doing
					school online as a result of quarantine the problem has gotten a lot worse. Many students, including
					ourselves, have a hard time paying attention in online lectures and end up missing a major portion
					of the content. To solve this problem we created Swaying attention, a program that uses eye
					detection to track students dozing off and gives them a reminder to stay focused. To achieve this we
					used Python, OpenCV, D-lib, Arduino-C code and a Sparkfun ESP32 board. Our prototype is able to
					detect drowsiness and outputs a message to the student on a display as well as making noise with a
					buzzer to get their attention.

				</h3>
			</div>

			<div class="columns is-multiline is-desktop">
				<p class="intro1">
					In this project, two other electrical engineering students at UCSD and I wrote Arduino-C code that
					prints the distance a pulse travels upon meeting an obstacle. In addition, we have our code graph
					the distances onto Arduino IDEâ€™s serial monitor. We also integrated three LEDs and a buzzer to
					signify danger zones, and an IR Remote and Receiver to pause the HC-SR04 sensor. We also implemented
					a DHT11 temperature/humidity sensor to detect whether the obstacle is inanimate or not.

			</div>

			<div class="columns is-multiline is-desktop">
				<p class="intro1">
					In this project, I used an Arduino Mega to have lined up LEDs light up one-by-one. Then, using
					MATLAB, a second breadboard, a servo motor, and photoresistors, I had a board with the
					photoresistors on it follow the lights as they turn on.

					'19)</h3>
			</div>

			<div class="columns is-multiline is-desktop">
				<p class="intro1">
					While working in the Experimental Mechanics Laboratory of Dr. George Youssef in San Diego State
					University for 5 weeks, myself, with the help of other members of the lab, created a makeshift
					aluminum ASTM D638 Standard mold and used an oven to melt plastic in it. We also used the lab's 3D
					printing technology to create some vertical, horizontal, and flat ASTM D638 samples. We then
					determined the tensile strength of the samples using a tensile strength testing machine. At the end
					of the five weeks, I made and presented a slideshow about my project in front of members of the lab.
					This amazing educational experience gave me a glimpse of the life of a student working in the
					Experimental Mechanics Laboratory.
