 <!-- Step 8: Adding a CV/resume page
This is a more freeform step, with the goal of getting you to explore HTML on your own and experiment. Add a new page to your website (and link to it from the navigation menu) that contains your CV or resume.

If you do not want to publish your CV on the Web for privacy reasons, you can use fake data for all or part of it. In that case, try to keep the structure as close as possible to your real CV and simply change the actual data (e.g. names, dates, places) so that you are still solving a realistic use case.

Structure the different sections of content with <section> elements. Think of <section> as the units of content that you would list in a table of contents for that page (which is exactly how they are exposed to assistive technology users).

You may also find <article> useful for structuring independent, self-contained units of content (“article” as in “article of clothing” not “newspaper article” — yes, it is confusing!).

Elements you will need (excluding those outside <body>):

Headings, paragraphs, lists
<a> for links
<section> and <article> (see above)
<time> for dates
Elements you may need:

<header> for <section> or <article> headers that are more than just a heading
<img> in case you want to include icons or logos of organizations
Don’t forget to preview your changes locally first, then when you’re happy with them commit and push to GitHub.
